# Web Crawler

This is a simple web crawler which creates a graph of the out connections which it contains. It was started during my IB CompSci HL class.

## Running it

### Installing Dependencies

Since the project is set up with pipenv you need to have it installed. Once that is set up:

```bash
pipenv install
```

### Running (Pipenv Shell)

```bash
pipenv shell #activate the shell
python3 main.py # run main.py with python3
```

### Running (Pipenv Run)

```bash
pipenv run python3 main.py
```
